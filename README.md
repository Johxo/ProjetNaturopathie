# ProjetNaturopathie

My first project as a developper. 
I'm switching from wine business to web development and lurning myself the basis of coding.

What I did: 
Creation of a service website for a natural health practitioner (Naturopathy) as an excercise to develop, show and develop skills in HTML, CSS, JS in a real situation.
This website is made for my beloved one to help her achieving her goals.
To build up the project we acted like if she was my client with meetings to start the project and implement the features suiting her activity and modify the design if needed.

The website is finished and mobile responsive.

Still considered as a work in progress as I have plans to develop new features for the practioner to manage the health history, health survey and guidance of her patients directly through the website. I still need to lurn the way to be able to do so
